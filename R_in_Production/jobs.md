## Jobs

A job is a way of running a notebook either immediately or on a scheduled basis. You can create and run jobs using the UI, the CLI, and by invoking the Jobs API. You can monitor job run results in the UI, using the CLI, by querying the API, and through email alerts([source](https://docs.databricks.com/jobs.html)). The `bricskteR` package possesses convenient wrappers for the Jobs API, making it easy to manage jobs from R.

Let's go through these options with examples, one by one.

#### Notebook Job from the Jobs UI

...


#### Submit Job with Databricks CLI
2. Through the REST API
3. Through the CLI
4. Using the `bricksteR` package

#### Invoke the Jobs API



#### `bricksteR`

`bricksteR` builds off the Jobs API, making it easy to create, run, and manage R jobs on Databricks.  You can find the package on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RafiKurlansik/bricksteR), and the vignette is [included](https://github.com/marygracemoesta/R-User-Guide/blob/master/R_in_Production/brickster.md) as part of this user guide.
